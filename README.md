## To Do (Minor):
- Still need to figure out the kinks in the 'Don't Forget' page (will make it easier to do all the other pages)
- Complete layouts for 'confirm information,' 'all set,' and one of the general information pages. 
- Need to add links to relevant information on each page & sync all the pages up with one another 

## To Do (Major):
- Need to figure out how to leverage Google Map's API and implement it on the location screens
- Need to figure out how to use JavaScript's forms functions
